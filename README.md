# Occupancy-Detection
In the project, the accuracy of predicting occupancy in a Rural Workplace using data from light, temperature, humidity, and CO2 sensors was assessed using several statistical classification models and Neural Networks. In this study, three data sets were used: one for training and two for testing the models when the office door was open and closed. Training Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, K closest neighbours, Kernelized SVM, and Naive Bayes typically yielded the best accuracies (ranging from 95% to 99%). The findings suggest that a well-chosen set of features combined with a well-chosen classification model can have a significant impact on accuracy prediction. The timestamp data had been incorporated into the models, which usually improved the detection accuracy. Information from the time stamp was included in the models, and that increased the accuracy of detection. Interestingly, using only two predictors (Light and CO2) in almost all the models sufficed to predict with accuracy as high as 98%.
